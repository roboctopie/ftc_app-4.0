# Welcome to Roboctopi's FTC 2018 submission!

## Who are we?
Hello, we’re Team Roboctopi, a small independent (not affiliated with any school or organization) robotics team in Southern California competing in the [2018-2019 First Tech Challenge (FTC): Rover Ruckus](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). We’ve spent the last 2 years building our skills by participating in [First Lego League(FLL)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) robotics competition and now, we’re ready to move up to the next level.
### Our Team
* Seth (me): My name is Seth. I am an 11-year-old who loves to code. I also like fixing devices and playing on my Nintendo Switch. I know 7 computer languages. I just joined the team this year and I'm excited to start.
* Logan: My name is Logan. I just started junior high school. I love cats, programming and playing piano. My other interests are Physics, Encryption and AI neural nets. I also like to play Kerbal Space Program.
* Nico: I am a level 7 competitive gymnast, and work out 15 hours a week. I love music and play the piano. In my spare time, I like to read mystery books (my favorite series is Harry Potter). I love science and am excited for this season of robotics.
* Cannon: I am a Junior at Valley Center High School. My favorite subjects are science and math. I like working with my hands whether it be building things or working on cars.
* Alex: I am Alex and I am thrilled to be part of Roboctopi this season. I have just started High School and robotics is one of my many interests along with fencing, solving rubik’s cube, juggling, and reading.
